This is the code from the YouTube series "Robinhood trading bot - How to Build a Robinhood auto-stock trader in python"

If you would like to see the videos where I write and discuss how everything works:

To run the code:
1. place all files in the same folder 
2. place your USERNAME and PASSWORD to "config.py"
3. modify "trade_strat.py" to your personal trading strategy
4. modify the "get_stocks()" function in the "trader.py" file with your stocks to watch
5. un-comment the "sell()" and "buy()" functions in the "trader.py" file when you are ready to trade on the live market
